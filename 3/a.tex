\subsection{}

The voltage applied to the load is just a square wave, with an amplitude of $V_d=\unit[200]{V}$.
The RMS value of a square wave (no dc offset) is just the height.

$$
V_{L_{rms}} = V_d = \unit[200]{V}
$$

\todo[inline]{2 marks for that? Am I missing something? Do they want us to actually do the integral?}
