I'm assuming that the current increases during the reverse recovery at the same speed as the rest of the rise.

\begin{align*}
Q_{rr}   & = \frac{1}{2} t_{rr} \Delta I \\
\Delta I & = \frac{2Q_{rr}}{t_rr} \\
         & = \frac{2 \times 40n}{20n} \\
         & = \unit[4]{A} \\
I_{max}  & = I + \Delta I \\
         & = 10 + 4 \\
         & = \unit[14]{A}
\end{align*}
